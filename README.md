# Java Data Structures Menu System

This is a console-based Java program that demonstrates the basic operations of four fundamental data structures: **Stack**, **Queue**, **Singly Linked List**, and **Circular Linked List** using an interactive menu.

## How It Works
- The program displays a main menu where the user can select a data structure.
- Each data structure has its own set of operations:
  - **Stack**: Push, Pop, Display
  - **Queue**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Display
  - **Singly Linked List**: Insert at End, Delete at Beginning, Display
  - **Circular Linked List**: Insert, Delete, Display
- The program validates user inputs and displays the updated structure after each operation.
