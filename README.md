# Data Structure Operations in Java

Welcome to the **Java Data Structure Console Program**.  
This project demonstrates the basic operations of different data structures in a simple, menu-driven format.  

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
The workspace includes the following structure:

- `src` → contains the Java source code file(s).  
- `bin` → compiled output files (generated after build).  
- `lib` → dependencies folder (if needed).  
- `README.md` → documentation for the project.  

> You can adjust the folder layout or build settings inside `.vscode/settings.json` if using Visual Studio Code.

## ⚙️ Program Features
This project lets the user choose among **four data structures** and perform their basic operations:

- **Stack** → Push, Pop, Display  
- **Queue** → Enqueue, Dequeue, Display  
- **Linked List** → Insert at End, Delete at Beginning, Display  
- **Circular Linked List** → Insert, Delete, Display  

After each operation, the current contents of the data structure are displayed.
